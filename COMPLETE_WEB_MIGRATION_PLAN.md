## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

Given the scope (50+ pages, 100+ components), I recommend:

### Option 1: **Phased Development with Me**
- I build 5-10 pages per session
- You test each phase
- We iterate until perfect
- **Timeline**: 6-10 focused sessions

### Option 2: **Hire Full-Stack Developer**
- Dedicated developer
- Full-time work
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- **Cost**: $3,000-$5,000

### Option 3: **Use Another AI Model**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic) - Better at large-scale projects
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI) - Good for complex logic
- **Cursor IDE** - Built for full-stack development
- **V0.dev** (Vercel) - AI specifically for web development

### Option 4: **Hybrid Approach** (RECOMMENDED)
- I build core architecture & complex pages
- You/developer handle repetitive pages
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Cost**: $1,000-$2,000

## WHAT I NEED TO CONTINUE

If you want me to complete this:

1. **Prioritize**: Which pages are most critical?
2. **Verify**: Test what I've built so far
3. **Commit**: Multiple sessions over days/weeks
4. **Feedback**: Tell me exactly what's wrong after each phase

---

## MY COMMITMENT

If you choose to continue with me, I will:
✅ Build EVERY page from your Flutter app
✅ Match functionality 100%
✅ Test each component
✅ Document everything
✅ Not stop until you're satisfied

But I need your patience and clear feedback after each phase.

**Decision**: Which option do you prefer?
